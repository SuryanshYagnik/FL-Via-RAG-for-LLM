# FL-Via-RAG-for-LLM
In this work, we propose a novel Federated Learning (FL) architecture for Large Language Models (LLMs) that integrates Hybrid
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance knowledge retrieval and adaptation across decentralized data sources. Our
approach begins by splitting the dataset into three subsets, each used to fine-tune an independent LLM instance. We then incorporate
RAG for efficient retrieval, enabling each model to leverage structured and unstructured external knowledge sources. Finally,
we employ federated learning techniques—such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg)—to aggregate these fine-tuned models into
a globally optimized LLM, ensuring privacy preservation and improved generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method enhances model adaptability, mitigates data silos, and maintains competitive performance across diverse tasks. This
framework paves the way for scalable and decentralized LLM training while addressing challenges in data privacy, efficiency, and
retrieval-based reasoning
